# Shuffle So Good!
Online music streaming platforms are missing a feature flaw that hampers the way I consume music:  
I cannot shuffle a massive playlist and also retain that shuffled state acrosss sessions!  
Here is my solution: Shuffle the order of the playlist as it appears on the server before each play-through, then I only have to remember the number of the track where I left off.
# `DEV PLAN`
1. `[ ]` Obtain track information for an entire playlist
1. `[ ]` Reorder one item
1. `[ ]` Reorder all items
1. `[ ]` Re-create the [YouTube Solution](https://github.com/jwatson-CO-edu/yt_shuffle_so_good/blob/main/youtube/03_reorder_all.ipynb) for [Spotify](https://stmorse.github.io/journal/spotify-api.html)!
